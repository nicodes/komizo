# komizo

CLI for preparing and operating your own Compose hosts over SSH. No hosted account is required. Run it only against hosts you own or administer.

## Install and use

Use a verified release archive or the Go toolchain matching `go.mod` and `.mise.toml`.

```sh
go install github.com/nicodes/komizo@latest
komizo --help
komizo init --host root@your-server
```

`init` prepares the host and requires privileged access. Review its changes before using it on an existing host. `komizo list`, `komizo report` and `komizo logs` inspect applications; see command help for current flags. The local UI is available through the CLI’s `ui` command.

The supported deployment operation is app-scoped Compose deployment. Historical journaled rollout releases v0.0.30–v0.0.39 are superseded by v0.0.40 and later. Deployment actions are in [komizo-actions](https://github.com/nicodes/komizo-actions). Verify release checksums and attestations before running a downloaded binary.
